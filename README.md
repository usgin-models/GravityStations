This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Gravity Station Observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook presents a content model for interchange of observations of the acceleration of gravity. Fields in the content model will become XML elements in interchange documents for WFS simple feature in the USGIN system; fields include Observed Gravity (mgal), Complete Bouguer Anamaly (mgal), and Free Air Correction (mgal), as well as Instrument and Base Station.

Services are not yet deployed using this information exchange; approval of the content model is awaited with the project working group at gdsdpwg.org.
